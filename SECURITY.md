# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version               | Supported          |
| -------               | ------------------ |
| Latest                | :white_check_mark: |
| Any outdated version  | :x: |

In general, I don't update old versions, only release new ones. (e.g if the latest version was v1.0, I would release v1.01)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the security tab to send a vulnerability report (obviously).

You can expect an update pretty soon after reporting a vulnerability. If I don't respond i'm probably busy with other stuff.
A hotfix will be released as soon as possible to fix a security vulnerability.
