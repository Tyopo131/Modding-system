# Modding system
You will find the security policy [here](https://github.com/Tyopo131/Modding-system/blob/dev/SECURITY.md)

I'm writing this project for fun to test my coding skills and to make the [Legacy modding system](https://github.com/Tyopo131/Legacy-modding-system) better.
You can expect updates soon after creating any issues/pull requests, if I don't respond I'm probably busy.
